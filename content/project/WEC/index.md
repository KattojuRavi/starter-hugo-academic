Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) to the wrist represent significant risk factors leading to serious long-term injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, shoulder, and neck pain. Wrist extension is a common posture related issue experienced by many young adults, desk job employees, and programmers who are prone to working for long durations at their computers for work/gaming activities.  We developed "Correct-Me", a real-time physiological feedback system that employed bend sensors to actively detect stress on the wrist and dynamically correct improper wrist posture and extension utilizing EMS. We developed a novel flexible 3D printed glove instrumented with embedded bend sensors for detection of wrist positions and integration with EMS (illustrated in Figure 1).

Correct-Me continuously monitors the wrist for extension which is obtained from bend sensors placed strategically in the glove on the back of the hand at the wrist joint. When wrist extension is detected (illustrated in Figure 1), EMS was automatically applied to the forearm to invoke an involuntary muscular contraction which generates a physiological response of restoring the wrist back to neutral position and thereby correcting wrist extension (illustrated in Figure 2a and 2b). Future work includes conducting a user study to determine the effectiveness of our automatic approach against traditional audio, visual, vibrotactile feedback systems in an ecologically valid setting such as typing, drawing, and gaming.
