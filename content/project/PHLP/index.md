• Design, development, testing and validation of a new vibrational energy harnessing prototype for power generation.
• Developed electro-magnetic induction-based energy harvester to generate energy from ambient vibrations during
physical activities in humans and in heavy industrial machinery.
• Demonstrated energy generation and harvesting to drive low power sensors.
